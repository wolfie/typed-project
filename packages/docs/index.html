<div id="TableOfContents"></div>

<p>Since I&#39;ve been working with TypeScript in recent years, I&#39;ve grown to love its type system quite a lot. I love how <code>tsserver</code> tells me off whenever I call functions with wrong parameters, or when I try to read data from non-existent object parameters, or when I try to return complete nonsensical data from functions. It just sits there, in the background, snickering at me and my mistakes. &quot;Well, smarty-pants, since you&#39;re so smart with your smarts and knowledge of what is correct programming and what is not, why don&#39;t you just fix my code for me?&quot; I said. And this gave me an idea: Why wouldn&#39;t I let <code>tsserver</code> fix my code for me?</p>
<p>Well, some of the code at least. In certain situations.</p>
<p>To paint a bit of a background picture, the projects that I&#39;ve been exposed to in the recent years have all been quite similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>A React front-end running in the browser, that communicates with…</li>
<li>A BFF (backend-for-frontend), which, in turn, collects data from…</li>
<li>Various backend services and/or databases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time we communicate across these gaps, data gets collected, transformed, transferred, read and finally distributed back. Even though compilation-time type safety would be rock-solid, there&#39;s very little we get for free when data is sent to and especially received from over the network.</p>
<p>My experience has taught me that the less we use overly broad data types, and the less we assume that an external service gives the data in a certain format, the less time I need to spend fixing bugs and researching unexpected system behavior.</p>
